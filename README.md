<h4>Possible errors:-</h4>
1. Multiple java versions<br>
use command "cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines" and then do "ls to check.<br><br>
2. Not able to find emulator even when emulator is running or getting no local.properties file<br>
create a file nameed "local.properties" under project->android folder<br>
add the below line in that file by adding your username<br>
sdk.dir = /Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk
<br>
this is the default location of SDK, if its different for you, then you need to add your SDK location.<br>
